# ADR-0001: Real-time NeRF Rendering Architecture

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-08-02
**Authors**: Terragon Labs
**Reviewers**: Architecture Team

## Context

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) traditionally require significant computation time for high-quality rendering, making real-time applications challenging. With the emergence of spatial computing devices like Apple Vision Pro, there's a critical need for NeRF rendering that can achieve 90+ FPS with sub-5ms latency while maintaining visual quality.

Key constraints:
- Target platforms: Vision Pro (90 FPS), iPhone 15 Pro (60 FPS), Web (60 FPS)
- Power budgets: Vision Pro (8W), iPhone (3W), Variable for Web
- Quality requirements: Maintain visual fidelity for immersive experiences
- Latency requirements: Sub-5ms for spatial computing applications

## Decision

We will implement a hierarchical real-time NeRF architecture with the following key components:

1. **Foveated Rendering Pipeline**: Dynamic quality adaptation based on eye-tracking data
2. **Hierarchical Ray Marching**: Octree acceleration structures for efficient spatial traversal
3. **Neural Caching System**: Pre-computed features for static scene regions
4. **Multi-resolution Representation**: LOD system with temporal upsampling
5. **Platform-specific Backends**: Metal for iOS, WebGPU for web, with unified API

## Consequences

### Positive
- Achieves target performance metrics across all platforms
- Maintains high visual quality through intelligent optimization
- Enables new classes of spatial computing applications
- Provides unified development experience across platforms
- Reduces power consumption through foveated rendering

### Negative
- Increased architectural complexity compared to traditional NeRF
- Requires eye-tracking data for optimal performance
- Memory usage higher than traditional graphics pipelines
- Development complexity for multi-platform optimization

### Neutral
- Requires specialized hardware for optimal performance
- Learning curve for developers new to NeRF technology
- Dependency on modern GPU capabilities

## Implementation

1. **Core Engine**: TypeScript/WebGPU foundation with Metal backend for iOS
2. **Neural Network**: Optimized architectures for each platform (ANE, GPU)
3. **Rendering Pipeline**: Multi-pass rendering with foveation support
4. **Memory Management**: Smart caching and LOD systems
5. **Platform Abstraction**: Unified API across all target platforms
