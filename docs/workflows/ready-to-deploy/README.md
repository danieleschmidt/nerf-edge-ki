# Ready-to-Deploy GitHub Actions Workflows

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: These workflow files are ready for production deployment but could not be automatically deployed due to GitHub App permission limitations.

## Files in this Directory

### Core Workflows (Production Ready)
- `ci.yml` - Complete CI pipeline with multi-platform testing, security scanning, and quality gates
- `release.yml` - Automated release pipeline with semantic versioning and package publishing

## Manual Deployment Instructions

Repository maintainers with `workflows` permission should deploy these files:

### Step 1: Create Workflows Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Step 2: Copy Workflow Files
```bash
cp docs/workflows/ready-to-deploy/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows/ready-to-deploy/release.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: deploy GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

- Add comprehensive CI pipeline with multi-platform testing
- Add automated release pipeline with semantic versioning
- Complete SDLC implementation automation"
git push origin main
```

## Workflow Features

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
- **Multi-platform Testing**: Node.js (18, 20), Python (3.9, 3.10, 3.11), iOS/macOS
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy, npm audit, Python safety, container scanning
- **Performance Testing**: Automated benchmarking with regression detection
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Black, MyPy, SonarCloud, CodeQL
- **Build Validation**: Web application, Python packages, Docker images
- **Artifact Management**: Build artifacts, test results, security reports

### Release Pipeline (`release.yml`)
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automated version determination and changelog
- **Multi-platform Builds**: Web, Python, iOS frameworks, Docker images
- **Package Publishing**: NPM, PyPI, Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry
- **Release Management**: GitHub releases with artifacts and release notes
- **Deployment Automation**: Staging deployment with smoke tests
- **Notification**: Slack integration for release announcements

## Prerequisites

Before deploying these workflows, ensure the following repository secrets are configured:

### Required Secrets
- `NPM_TOKEN` - NPM authentication for package publishing
- `PYPI_TOKEN` - PyPI API token for Python package publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Codecov integration for coverage reporting
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - SonarCloud integration for code quality
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Docker Hub username for container publishing
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Docker Hub access token
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - Slack webhook for notifications (optional)

### Repository Settings
- Enable branch protection on `main` branch
- Require status checks: `test-web`, `test-python`, `security-scan`, `performance`
- Enable third-party integrations (Codecov, SonarCloud, Dependabot)

## Validation

After deployment, validate the workflows by:
1. Creating a test pull request to trigger CI pipeline
2. Merging to main branch to trigger release pipeline (if commits warrant a release)
3. Checking all status checks pass successfully
4. Verifying artifacts are created and published correctly

## Support

For issues with workflow deployment:
1. Verify GitHub App has `workflows` permission
2. Check repository secrets are properly configured
3. Ensure branch protection rules allow workflow execution
4. Review workflow logs for any integration issues

These workflows represent the completion of the comprehensive SDLC implementation for nerf-edge-kit.
