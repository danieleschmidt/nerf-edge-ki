# Project Charter: nerf-edge-kit

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Status**: Active  
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly

## Executive Summary

The nerf-edge-kit project aims to democratize real-time Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rendering for spatial computing by creating a comprehensive, multi-platform SDK that enables photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction and rendering on edge devices.

## Project Vision

**"Enable any developer to integrate photorealistic 3D scene rendering into spatial computing applications with sub-5ms latency and production-ready performance."**

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Neural Radiance Fields require significant computational resources for high-quality rendering
- Existing NeRF implementations are research-focused, not production-ready
- Spatial computing devices like Apple Vision Pro demand 90+ FPS with strict power budgets
- No unified SDK exists for cross-platform NeRF development
- High barrier to entry for developers wanting to use NeRF technology

### Market Opportunity
- $31B spatial computing market expected by 2030
- 500M+ AR/VR capable devices projected by 2025
- Growing demand for photorealistic content in XR applications
- Enterprise adoption requiring production-grade solutions
